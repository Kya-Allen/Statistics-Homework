# Statistics-Homework
A repository of IPython Notebooks containing statistical analyses I've done as Homework, as well as reports on each. ( 

at present, the work in this repository is from STAT 414: Environmental Statistics.
The Class covered the following topics:
    - Review of Hypothesis testing and Linear Regression
    - Environmental Sampling Methods
    - Statistical Modeling with Binomial, Poisson, and Exponential distributions
    - Testing for Exponentiality/Normality/Lognormality
    - Polynomial Regression
    - Estimation of Censored Data with Maximum-Likelihood Estimation (and Fisher Information) 
    - Modeling Dose-Response relations / risk modeling
    - Multistage Weibull Model

The Data in the assignments were generally given to us with no context, and so we were asked to make up a situation for our reports
